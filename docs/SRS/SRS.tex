\section{Introduction}
{
Helmholtz coils are utilized primarily for their ability to produce a nearly uniform magnetic field, a feature crucial in various scientific research and practical applications. The design consists of two identical electromagnetic coils placed symmetrically along a common axis and separated by a distance equal to their radius, having the same electric current in the same direction. It facilitates precise control over the magnetic field's strength by adjusting the electric current flowing through the coils. Alternatively, a Maxwell coil configuration is formed if currents flow in opposite directions, resulting in a uniform magnetic field gradient at the center. This precision is essential for applications that demand specific magnetic force and torque on a magnetic particle to induce desired effects on materials or biological tissues. Calculating the target magnetic field and magnetic torque based on the characteristics of a Helmholtz Coil system and magnetic particles significantly impact a wide range of scientific, medical, and industrial applications.
}

\subsection{Purpose of Document}
{
The primary objective of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to outline the software requirements for creating a Three-axis Helmholtz Coil System Current Calculator for Target Magnetic Force and Magnetic Torque application. This document endeavors to provide a thorough understanding of the system's architecture, focusing on the project's objectives, operational principles, and essential definitions without focusing on the implementation specifics. It aims to establish a clear overview to facilitate software development, detailing the system's context, constraints, and the problem the project intends to solve. Furthermore, the document considers possible future enhancements and modifications, ensuring the system's adaptability and scalability to meet evolving requirements.
}

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 
{
The project's scope is concentrated on developing a current calculator for a Three-axis Helmholtz Coil System that precisely determines the currents required to achieve a target magnetic force and torque at the system's central point. This calculator assumes an idealized scenario where the coil system is entirely isolated from any external magnetic fields, ensuring that calculations are unaffected by outside magnetic interference. The software's focus is on theoretical predictions and is not concerned with the physical implementation or the dynamic adaptation to environmental changes. The resulting tool will be critical for applications necessitating precise magnetic field manipulation, serving as a foundational resource for further experimental and practical exploration.
}  

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}
{
The reader should have a strong foundation in physics, particularly in electromagnetism. A university-level understanding, at least at the undergraduate level, is expected. Familiarity with differential calculus and vector analysis is necessary since the project involves calculating magnetic field gradients and currents.

}

\subsection{Organization of Document}
{
This document is based on the template provided by \citet{SmithandLai2005}.The document is organized into several key sections to present the software requirements specification systematically. After the introduction, which outlines the document's purpose, scope, and definitions, the general system description provides an overview of the system's context and interactions. Subsequently, The system description discusses the problem, assumptions, and dependencies. The requirements section details the functional and nonfunctional requirements, followed by a discussion on likely and unlikely changes to the system. The document also includes traceability matrices to illustrate the relationships between different components of the SRS, ensuring clear reference and maintenance.

instance models and their derivation is also presented, so that the instance
models can be verified.

\subsubsection{Assumptions} \label{sec_assumpt}
This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the

The numbers given in the square brackets refer to the theoretical model [TM],
general definition [GD], data definition [DD], instance model [IM], or likely
change [LC], in which the respective assumption is used.

\begin{itemize}

The equation represents the magnetic field $B$ along the axis of a coil with multiple turns.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(B\): The magnetic field at a point along the axis of the coil(\si{\tesla}).

\subsubsection*{Detailed derivation of magnetic field along the axis of it }
{For a small current element \(Id\mathbf{l}\) on the loop, the \tref{TM:BSL} gives the magnetic field contribution \(d\mathbf{B}\) at point \(x\) on the axis.\\

By symmetry, only the component of \(d\mathbf{B}\) that is along the axis (the \(x\)-component) contributes to the net field at point \(x\). The field due to each element is directed according to the right-hand rule, which, given your description, points to the right along the axis of the loop for the entire loop.\\


Using the Biot-Savart Law, the \(x\)-component of the field due to the element is \(dB_x = dB \cdot \sin(\theta)\), where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(d\mathbf{l}\) and \(\mathbf{r}\). Because \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{r}{R}\) and \(r = \sqrt{x^2 + R^2}\), the \(x\)-component of \(d\mathbf{B}\) is given by:
\[
dB_x = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{IdlR}{(x^2 + R^2)^{3/2}}
\]
\\
The integral \(\int d\mathbf{l}\) around the loop gives the circumference \(2\pi R\), so the net magnetic field at point \(x\) is:
\[
B_x = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{I}{(x^2 + R^2)^{3/2}} \int d\mathbf{l} = \frac{\mu_0 IR}{2(x^2 + R^2)^{3/2}}
\]Which is the magnetic field at a distance \(x\) from the center of the loop along its axis. \\


For a coil with \( N \) turns, this expression is multiplied by \( N \), since each turn contributes to the magnetic field at the point \( x \). Therefore, the total magnetic field \( B_x \) due to a coil with \( N \) turns is
\[
B_x = \frac{N \mu_0 I R^2}{2(x^2 + R^2)^{3/2}}
\]

These calculations can be generalized for the y and z axis, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the magnetic field in three-dimensional space.

Each coil produces its own magnetic field, and because the coils are arranged along the same axis and the currents flow in the same direction, the magnetic fields generated by the individual coils add up constructively in the space between them.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(B\): The magnetic field at a point along the axis of the coil(\si{\tesla}).
    \item \(N\): The number of turns in the coil. Each turn contributes to the total magnetic field, so the field strength is proportional to the number of turns.
    \item \(\mu_0\): The magnetic constant or the permeability of free space, which is \(4\pi \times 10^{-7}\, \si{\tesla\meter\per\ampere}\) (\si{\tesla\meter\per\ampere}).
    \item \(I\): The current through the coil(\si{\ampere}).
    \item \(R\): The radius of the coil(\si{\meter}).
    \item \(x\): The distance from the center of the coil along its axis to the point(\si{\meter}).
    \item \(l\): The distance between two coils(\si{\meter}).

\subsubsection*{Detailed derivation of magnetic field along the axis of a coil }
In a Maxwell coil setup, we have two identical circular coils that are spaced a distance apart equal to their radius. Each coil produces its own magnetic field, and because the coils are arranged along the same axis and the currents flow in the opposite direction, the magnetic fields generated by the individual coils are oppose each other.

\subsubsection{Data Definitions}\label{sec_datadef}

This section collects and defines all the data needed to build the instance
models. The dimension of each quantity is also given. 
~\newline

\subsubsection{Instance Models} \label{sec_instance}    

This section transforms the problem defined in Section~\ref{Sec_pd} into 
one which is expressed in mathematical terms. It uses concrete symbols defined 
in Section~\ref{sec_datadef} to replace the abstract symbols in the models 
identified in Sections~\ref{sec_theoretical} and~\ref{sec_gendef}.

The goals \gsref{G_force} and \gsref{G_torque} are solved by \iref{cnf} and \iref{cnt} respectively.

  Description& With condisitons\aref{A_generateWithinCenter},\aref{A_noExtField},and $B$ from \dref{mfcm} we calculate the spatial derivative of $B_x$ with respect to x, which describes how the field changes along the axis. 

$\frac{d}{dx}B_x\left( x \right) =-\frac{3\mu _0N_xI_xR_{x}^{2}x}{2\left( x^2+R_{x}^{2} \right) ^{5/2}}+\frac{3\mu _0N_xI_xR_{x}^{2}\left( x-l_x \right)}{2\left( \left( l_x-x \right) ^2+R_{x}^{2} \right) ^{5/2}}$

The gradient is then evaluated at the midpoint between the two coils $x=l/2$, which is typically where measurements are taken

$\left. \frac{d}{dx}B_x\left( x \right) \right|_{x=\frac{l_x}{2}}=-\frac{3\mu _0N_xI_xR_{x}^{2}l_x}{2\left( \frac{l_{x}^{2}}{4}+R_{x}^{2} \right) ^{5/2}}$

By using \dref{TM:FBD} we reach to the equation below.

$F_x=-\frac{3\mu _0N_xI_xR_{x}^{2}l_x}{2\left( \frac{l_{x}^{2}}{4}+R_{x}^{2} \right) ^{5/2}}m_x$

The following relationship is derived by rearranging the previous equation to isolate the current, allowing for the calculation of the current needed to achieve a specific magnetic force.

$\Longrightarrow I_x=-\frac{2\left( \frac{l_{x}^{2}}{4}+R_{x}^{2} \right) ^{5/2}}{3\mu _0N_xR_{x}^{2}l_xm_x}F_x$

The same calculation can be applied for $I_y$ and $I_z$

$\Longrightarrow I_y=-\frac{2\left( \frac{l_{y}^{2}}{4}+R_{y}^{2} \right) ^{5/2}}{3\mu _0N_yR_{y}^{2}l_ym_y}F_y$

$\Longrightarrow I_z=-\frac{2\left( \frac{l_{z}^{2}}{4}+R_{z}^{2} \right) ^{5/2}}{3\mu _0N_zR_{z}^{2}l_zm_z}F_z$

\subsubsection*{Derivation of Current needed for target torque}

Initially, expressions for $B$ specifically at $B_x\left( \frac{l_x}{2} \right)$ from $B$ from \dref{cfmh} are provided.

$B_x\left( x \right) =\frac{\mu _0N_xI_xR_{x}^{2}}{2\left( x^2+R_{x}^{2} \right) ^{3/2}}+\frac{\mu _0N_xI_xR_{x}^{2}}{2\left( \left( l_x-x \right) ^2+R_{x}^{2} \right) ^{3/2}}$

$B_x\left( \frac{l_x}{2} \right) =\frac{\mu _0N_xI_xR_{x}^{2}}{\left( \frac{l_{x}^{2}}{4}+R_{x}^{2} \right) ^{3/2}}=C_xI_x$

The overall magnetic field is decomposed into components parallel ($\vec{B}_{\parallel}$) and perpendicular ( $\vec{B}_{\bot}$ to the magnetic moment, noting that only the perpendicular component contributes to the torque. 

$\vec{B}=\vec{B}_{\bot}+\vec{B}_{\parallel}$

$\vec{m}\cdot \vec{B}_{\bot}=0$

$\vec{m}\times \vec{B}_{\parallel}=0$

$\vec{\tau}\begin{array}{l}
 =\vec{m}\times \vec{B}\\
 =\vec{m}\times \left( \vec{B}_{\bot}+\vec{B}_{\parallel} \right)\\
 =\vec{m}\times \vec{B}_{\bot}+\underset{=0}{\underbrace{\vec{m}\times \vec{B}_{\parallel}}}\\
 =\vec{m}\times \vec{B}_{\bot}\\
\end{array}$

By using \tref{TM:TBD}:

$\vec{\tau}\times \vec{m}=\left( \vec{m}\times \vec{B}_{\bot} \right) \times \vec{m}$

$\vec{\tau}\times \vec{m}=m^2\vec{B}_{\bot}$

$\Rightarrow \vec{B}_{\bot}=\frac{1}{m^2}\vec{\tau}\times \vec{m}$

$\vec{B}_{\parallel}=0$

$\Rightarrow \vec{B}=\frac{1}{m^2}\vec{\tau}\times \vec{m}$

$B_x=\frac{1}{m^2}\left[ \tau _ym_z-\tau _zm_y \right] $

$\Rightarrow I_x=\frac{1}{\frac{m^2\mu _0N_xR_{x}^{2}}{\left( \frac{l_{x}^{2}}{4}+R_{x}^{2} \right) ^{3/2}}}\left[ \tau _ym_z-\tau _zm_y \right] $

$\Rightarrow I_y=\frac{1}{\frac{m^2\mu _0N_yR_{y}^{2}}{\left( \frac{l_{y}^{2}}{4}+R_{y}^{2} \right) ^{3/2}}}\left[ \tau _zm_x-\tau _xm_z \right] $

$\Rightarrow I_z=\frac{1}{\frac{m^2\mu _0N_zR_{z}^{2}}{\left( \frac{l_{z}^{2}}{4}+R_{z}^{2} \right) ^{3/2}}}\left[ \tau _xm_y-\tau _ym_x \right] $


\subsubsection{Input Data Constraints} \label{sec_DataConstraints}    

Table~\ref{TblInputVar} shows the data constraints on the input output
variables.  The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations
on the range of values that can be taken by the variable.  The column for
software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values.  The
software constraints will be helpful in the design stage for picking suitable
algorithms.  The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the
flexibility to experiment with unusual situations.  The column of typical values
is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.  The uncertainty column
provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be
measured.  This information would be part of the input if one were performing an
uncertainty quantification exercise.

\section{Requirements}

This section provides the functional requirements, the business tasks that the
software is expected to complete, and the nonfunctional requirements, the
qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

\subsection{Rationale}
{
The project focuses on designing a calculator to determine the currents required in a three-axis Helmholtz coil system for generating specific magnetic forces and torques. This scope is chosen to address the challenges in precise magnetic field manipulation, which is crucial for various scientific and industrial applications. Assumptions like direct current usage, isolation from external magnetic fields, and target magnetic field generation within the Helmholtz coil's center are made to simplify the model. These assumptions are based on typical conditions such a system operates, ensuring that the model remains relevant to real-world applications.

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] {The focus on generating the target magnetic force and torque specifically at the center of the Helmholtz coil system is a fundamental design element that is not expected to change throughout the lifetime of the project\aref{A_generateWithinCenter}.}

\end{itemize}

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
the assumptions.

The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on
what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  The
arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an
arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a
component is changed, the components that it points to should also be
changed.
